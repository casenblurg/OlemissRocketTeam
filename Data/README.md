###  Pressure Transducer (PX309-3KGV)

- **Sample Rate:** 2,000 Hz  
- **Response Time:** â‰ˆ 1 ms (per datasheet)  
- **Estimated Bandwidth:**  
  B â‰ˆ 0.35 / Response Time  
  â†’ B â‰ˆ 0.35 / 0.001 s = **350 Hz**

- **Nyquist Criterion:**

###  Load Cell (LC113B-2K)

- **Sample Rate:** 2,000 Hz  
- **Estimated Response Time:** 2â€“5 ms (typical for S-type load cells)  
- **Estimated Bandwidth:**  
  B â‰ˆ 0.35 / 0.002 s = **175 Hz**

- **Nyquist Criterion:**  
  fs > 2 Ã— B  
  â†’ 2000 Hz > 350 Hz âœ…

## âœ… Summary

The 2,000 Hz sampling rate satisfies the Nyquist Theorem for both sensors and ensures accurate time-domain capture of fast transients in thrust and chamber pressure data. A total of **30,000 samples** per channel were collected over the 15-second window, providing high-resolution insight into motor behavior.
