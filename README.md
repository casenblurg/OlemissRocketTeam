# 🚀 Solid Rocket Motor Test Stand – DAQ System Overview - Casey Heustess

Over the course of a year and a half (**Nov 2023 – April 2025**), I designed and built a data acquisition (DAQ) system for a **solid rocket motor (SRM) test stand**. This system was developed to accurately record **thrust** and **chamber pressure** data during static fire tests of **AeroTech reloadable SRMs**.

The DAQ setup interfaces with both a **load cell** and a **pressure transducer**, conditions their analog signals using amplification circuitry, and logs the data for post-processing and analysis.

## 💻 Software

- **NI LabVIEW**  
  Used to build the real-time data acquisition interface. It handled:
  - Signal acquisition
  - Relay control for ignition
  - Timing control and logging of thrust and pressure data

- **Microsoft Excel**  
  LabVIEW export the data into Excel spreadsheets. Each test generates:
  - Raw load cell voltage
  - Raw pressure transducer voltage
  - Converted thrust (lbf)
  - Converted chamber pressure (psi)

## 📘 Additional Information

The data analyzed in this repository comes from the **first hot fire test** ever recorded using this system and is used here for demonstration purposes. The goal of this repository is to showcase what can be done with acquired SRM test data. There are always better methods to explore, and continuous improvement is part of the process.

This project serves as a hands-on opportunity for me to strengthen my skills across **mechanical**, **electrical**, and **computer engineering**, as well as to sharpen my overall **data analysis abilities**, particularly in the context of **aerospace and rocketry**.
