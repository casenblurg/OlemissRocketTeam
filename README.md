# Overview

Over the course of a year and a half (Nov 2023 - April 2025) I instrumented a solid rocket motor (SRM) test stand. This data acquisition system (DAQ)  was developed to accurately record thrust and chamber pressure data from Aerotech solid rocket motors during static fire tests. The system captures static thrust and pressure data from both a load cell and a pressure transducer, conditions the signals, and stores the data for post-processing and analysis.
